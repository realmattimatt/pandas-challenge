    "### District VS Chart School Spending VS Resultser\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Based on the 2 datasets given for what would normally be called High School Reading and Math for the schools and districts provided. A few insights can be observed. \r\n",
    "1. District schools on average compared to Charter schools for all spending ranges. Have an \"Average Percent Overall Passing\" of approx. 75% for District schools, compared to approx. 71.5% for Charter schools. \r\n",
    "2. Medium schools, (1000-2000 students), overall have a higher passing rate of approx. 75.25%, compared to the Large (2000 - 5000), and Small (<1000) schools with overall passing rates of approx. 72.35 and 72 respectively.\r\n",
    "3. The spending summary is definitely interesting. The lowest range of spending (Per Student) group, has the largest impact and maybe?, contrary to conventional thinking, the largest impact in student success. The highest and lowest Per Student spending, had the worst results in \"Overall Passing\". The lowest was approx. 62.3 % compared to the highest spending at approx. 72 %. Meanwhile, the low - mid spending was at approx. 72 % passing, while the mid to high was at an astounding approx. 90.5 % passing. "
